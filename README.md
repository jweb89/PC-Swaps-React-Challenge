## Challenge
Create a simple react application that shows an infinite scrolling list of users. Once the person using your application is close to the bottom of the list, the application should fetch the next batch of users to display.  You man NOT use a library for infinite scrolling. However, any other libraries you wish to use to complete this project are acceptable(axios, css frameworks, etc.). This application should be responsive and look attractive on various screen sizes.

- To fetch the users you will be using the reqres.in api and this route:reqres.in/api/users?page=...
See full documentation here:https://reqres.in/

Please return your projects through a github link with instructions to run.
